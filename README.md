## üöÄ Executive Summary

**FactFuse** is an open-source, zero-cost AI-powered fact-checking platform designed for modern digital discourse. With the proliferation of misinformation, verifying facts across social media platforms has become essential. FactFuse seamlessly ingests content from platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit, automatically extracts factual claims, retrieves supporting or contradicting evidence from authoritative sources, and delivers verdicts with transparent, source-backed citations. Our mission is to build a free, scalable, and trustworthy verification infrastructure for everyone.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Accuracy & Trust**  
  Every verdict produced by FactFuse is supported by precise citations, ensuring users can trace back the evidence and trust the results.
- **Zero Licensing**  
  FactFuse is built exclusively on free, open-source models and libraries. You‚Äôll never encounter licensing fees or proprietary lock-in.
- **Scalability**  
  Leveraging a microservice architecture, FactFuse delivers sub-second response times and handles large-scale, concurrent requests with ease.
- **Extensibility**  
  The entire platform is modular, following a docs-as-code philosophy, making it easy for contributors to enhance, extend, or customize.
- **Multi-Platform Integration**  
  FactFuse connects with major social networks and messaging platforms via APIs/webhooks, enabling broad and flexible deployment.

## üîÅ Fact-Checking Pipeline

FactFuse‚Äôs pipeline is engineered for transparency, explainability, and reliability. Here‚Äôs how each stage works:

1. **Ingestion**
   - Connects to Facebook (Graph API), Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit via webhook adapters.
   - Normalizes raw payloads into a structured ‚Äúclaim‚Äù object using FastAPI.
   - Supports batch and real-time ingestion, with duplicate detection and basic spam filtering.

2. **Claim Extraction**
   - Utilizes spaCy and transformer-based classifiers to detect factual statements within content.
   - Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging isolate key terms and contextual cues.
   - Filters out non-factual or opinion statements to maximize relevance.

3. **Evidence Retrieval**
   - Employs a hybrid retrieval strategy: vector search (Milvus) for semantic similarity and keyword search (Elasticsearch) for precision.
   - Gathers and deduplicates the top-K most relevant evidence snippets from a curated knowledge base and the open web.
   - Applies domain and source credibility filters to improve result quality.

4. **Reranking**
   - Uses MonoT5, a transformer-based reranker, to rescore retrieved evidence based on contextual relevance to the original claim.
   - Applies additional heuristics for recency, authority, and diversity of sources.

5. **Grounded Verdict Generation**
   - Presents only the numbered evidence snippets to a language model (DeepSeek via OpenRouter).
   - Generates a grounded verdict, explicitly referencing the supporting or contradicting evidence (e.g., ‚ÄúClaim is unsupported [1][3].‚Äù).

6. **Verification**
   - Automatically re-queries all citations to confirm their ongoing validity.
   - Flags verdicts with unsupported or ambiguous evidence for human moderation.
